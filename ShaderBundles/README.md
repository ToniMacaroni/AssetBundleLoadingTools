Temporary fake "web service" that allows the library to pull in new .shaderbundle files

Eventually this should be converted to a real web service, but I wanted to make sure I had something to push .shaderbundle updates
If you have a .shaderbundle you'd like to be included, feel free to send a PR and i'll check it
